# Time Management
* Read Getting Stuff Done, by David Allen
* Stress is believing you have insufficient resources to achieve a given task.
* Stop open loops by externalising tasks (make a list)
* Transfer inbox to organiser and then clear. Plan in organiser.
* Do it (<2 mins), delegate it, defer it, drop it.

Natural planning stages:
1. Define purpose and principles. **Why** are you doing this?
2. Visualise/clarify the successful outcome. Think big.
3. Brainstorming, idea generation.
4. Organise, planning.
5. Next steps. What can be done right now?

Unnatural planning is reactive and the usually the reverse of the above.
Typically starting with unorganised action, and if that makes little progress,
a plan is made, then brainstorming, and finally someone asks why are we doing
this?

## Preferred tools
* GitLab issues for work.
* Google calendar for time-specific events, dates.
