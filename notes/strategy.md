# Strategy
This note summarises some lessons about strategy, mainly learned from the book
Good Strategy Bad Strategy.

## Bad Strategy
Four major hallmarks for Bad Strategy:

1. Fluff  
   Gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts for arguments.

2. Failure to face the challenge  
   Failure to face/recognise/define, cannot evaluate or improve strategy.

3. Mistaking goals for strategy  
   Bad strategies are just statements of desire, rather than plans.

4. Bad strategic objectives  
   Strategic objectives are means to ends. Bad ones fail to address critical
   issues, or when they are impracticable.
