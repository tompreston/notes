# Strategy
This note summarises some lessons about strategy, mainly learned from the book
Good Strategy Bad Strategy.

## Bad Strategy
Four major hallmarks for Bad Strategy:

1. Fluff  
   Gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts for arguments.

2. Failure to face/recognise/define the challenge  
   Which makes it difficult to evaluate and therefore improve the strategy.

3. Mistaking goals for strategy  
   Bad strategies are just statements of desire, rather than plans.

4. Bad strategic objectives  
   Strategic objectives are means to ends. Bad ones fail to address critical
   issues, or when they are impracticable. Eg. Blue-sky desired state of
   affairs.

How we get here:
* Unwillingness or inability to choose (fence sitting).
* Template style strategy "vision mission strategy".
* New Thought.

## Kernel of Good Strategy
1. Diagnosis, which defines and simplifies the problem.
2. Guiding policy, overall approach to overcome obstacles.
4. Coherent actions, to carry out 2.

## Sources of power
* Using leverage; prediction, changing variables, concentrating efforts for
  larger payoffs.
* Proximate objectives; work on knowns representative of unknowns, taking
  strong positions in the near term, master basic objectives before tackling
  more complex ones.
* TODO
