# Visual Studio Code
The CLI is just `code`.

I've been trying to move to vscode from vim for a while, but need to switch
back when I need to be fast.

This note is to help me get back up to speed with vscode.

Some keyboard shortcuts:
* `ctrl+'` show/hide terminal or switch between code/terminal.
* `ctrl+shift+5` split terminal
* `ctrl+N` go to code split
